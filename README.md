# NewExpressApp

An Express web application as a 1st challenge from mLab. The first project was an express app and
it was a framework based web app. It was bootstrapped. This is the 1st Express WebApp that is
purely written in HTML & CSS and JavaScript.

I need help with making the hours and minutes have the zero next to them when the number is less than 9.

##Clone the repository to your local machine

`$ git clone https://github.com/radlee/newExpressApp.git`

#Install node modules

`$ npm install`

##Start the Server

`$ node app.js`

##For easy restarts install nodemon

 `$ npm install nodemon`

`$ nodemon`

If you have any problems please add an issue and mention me in it and I will be there to help
